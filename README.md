Go to the frontend folder and open index.html file in browser.
This is frontend of the website.
Now open this index.html in text editor and edit it and make improvements and changes.
The css file is inside the css folder of frontend folder.

Similarly the html of index.html has been divided to following parts:
- body.html
- navigation.html
- footer.html
These files are also in same folder as index.html. You can also view them in browser or edit them and make changes.
